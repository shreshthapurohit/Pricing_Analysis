## 📊 Analysis Modules

### 1. Price vs Demand
Scatter plot showing how demand drops as price increases, with the optimal price point highlighted in red.

### 2. Revenue Insights
Identifies the price that generates maximum revenue using the formula:
```
Revenue = Price × Units Sold
```

### 3. Elasticity Analysis
Calculates price elasticity of demand:
```
Elasticity = % Change in Demand / % Change in Price
```
- **Elasticity > 1** → Customers are highly sensitive (elastic)
- **Elasticity < 1** → Customers are less sensitive (inelastic)

### 4. Discount Strategy
Simulates the revenue impact of applying a discount:
```
New Revenue = (Price × Discount%) × (Units Sold × Demand Boost%)
```
Adjust both sliders in real time to find the best discount scenario.

### 5. Competitor Comparison
Models competitor pricing by applying a markup percentage to your prices, plotted side-by-side.
